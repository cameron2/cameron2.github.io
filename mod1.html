    <h1>BASH man and help commands</h1>
    <pre>
    $ man man
    $ man apropos
    </pre>
    <p>
      The man command stands for "manual"; it opens documentation on various topics. 
      You use it by running the command man [topic] at the BASH prompt, where [topic] is the name of the page you wish to read.  
      Note that many of these pages are considerably longer than one printed page; 
      nevertheless, the name persists. Each command (application) on your system is likely to have a man page. 
      There are pages for other things too, such as system calls or specific configuration files.
